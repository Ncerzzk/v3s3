# Buildroot Package for Allwinner V3s/S3/S3L

> Support for S3/S3L coming soon

This repo contains a buildroot external tree, tailored to the V3s/S3/S3L SoCs from Allwinner with specific focus on embedded video processing. If you're looking to build a HMI-styled application, this repo probably isn't for you.

## Features

- Ethernet
- USB
- Camera interfaces (both DVP and MIPI CSI-2)
- H.264 baseline/main/high profile video encoding, up to 720p @ 60fps or 1080p @ 30fps (demo programs coming soon)
